-- Per-scene monotonic revision signal, at the DB layer (ported from the
-- reference implementation's migration 0071).
--
-- WHY THE DB LAYER: course content has several write seams that share no
-- application-level signal (HTTP routes, agent tools, jobs, migration
-- scripts, manual psql). Only a trigger can make "wrote but never signaled"
-- unexpressible. These companion tables and triggers keep a monotonic
-- per-stage revision and a per-scene revision on every insert/update/delete
-- of document_stages / document_scenes. Companion tables instead of columns
-- keep the document tables' authoritative DDL untouched.
--
-- LOCK ORDER INVARIANT: the scene trigger bumps document_stage_revision (SR)
-- BEFORE document_scene_revision (SCR) — the same order saveDocument uses
-- (stage upsert first, then per-scene upserts). Any future code that writes
-- these two companion tables must take SR before SCR, or the deadlock (40P01)
-- between concurrent stage-first and scene-first writers comes back.
--
-- NOTIFY: each bump emits a JSON route {kind:'stage',stageId} on the
-- agent-event wakeup channel (the same channel the reference's agent event
-- notify bus LISTENs on), so a stage notification wakes exactly the
-- subscribers listening for that stage. The payload is built with
-- json_build_object — never hand-concatenated, because a stageId containing
-- quotes or backslashes would yield invalid JSON.
--
-- NOTIFY SUPPRESSION SWITCH: both triggers check
-- current_setting('openmaic.suppress_stage_notify', true) before pg_notify.
-- Batch/backfill writers MUST run SET LOCAL openmaic.suppress_stage_notify =
-- 'on' inside each batch transaction: the revision still bumps, only the
-- notification is skipped. NOTE: SET LOCAL outside a transaction block only
-- emits a warning and has NO effect.
--
-- TRUNCATE DOES NOT FIRE ROW TRIGGERS: a TRUNCATE reset of document_scenes /
-- document_stages leaves the companion revision rows behind, so any TRUNCATE
-- reset must also truncate document_scene_revision and
-- document_stage_revision.
