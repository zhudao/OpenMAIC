/**
 * Versioned schema migrations for the PostgreSQL backends.
 *
 * Every backend (a *store*: documents, runtime, assets, ...) declares an
 * ordered list of migrations, numbered from 1. Version 1 is the baseline: the
 * idempotent DDL the store ran on every start before migrations were
 * versioned, so it is safe on a fresh database and on any database an earlier
 * release created. Everything after it runs exactly once per database.
 * Baselines run with `transaction: false`: their statements are idempotent one
 * by one, and running them one by one keeps the locks they take as short as
 * the pre-versioned bootstrap kept them (an `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT
 * EXISTS` takes ACCESS EXCLUSIVE even when the column exists, and inside one
 * transaction it would hold it until the whole baseline committed).
 *
 * What ran is recorded in `openmaic_schema_migrations`, one row per store and
 * version, with a checksum of the migration as it ran. On every start
 * {@link applySchemaMigrations}:
 *
 * - refuses to continue when the database records a version of the store newer
 *   than the running code knows ({@link SchemaVersionAheadError}): the database
 *   was upgraded by a newer release, and this one would read and write a schema
 *   it does not understand;
 * - compares the checksums of applied migrations with the code's, and fails
 *   (development and test) or warns (`NODE_ENV=production`) on a difference;
 * - applies the pending migrations in order, each in its own transaction unless
 *   the migration opts out, recording it in the same transaction (or, for one
 *   that opts out, after its last statement succeeded).
 *
 * Runs are serialized across sessions by a session-level advisory lock held
 * for the whole run, waited on for a bounded time, so two instances starting
 * together apply each migration once. A host that provisions several stores in
 * one sequence may still hold a lock of its own around all of them; the two do
 * not conflict. Session-level locks and multi-statement transactions need a
 * direct or session-pooled connection: a pooler in transaction mode (PgBouncer
 * `pool_mode = transaction`) is not supported.
 *
 * {@link verifySchemaMigrations} is the read-only half: it checks recorded
 * versions and checksums without creating or changing anything, for a host
 * that wants to refuse a database at startup before its lazy stores run.
 *
 * ## Adding a migration
 *
 * Append `{ version: <last + 1>, name, up }` to the store's list. Never edit or
 * remove a migration that has shipped: its checksum is recorded on every
 * database it ran on. A migration that cannot run inside a transaction (for
 * example `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`) sets `transaction: false` and must then
 * be idempotent on its own, because a failure part-way leaves it unrecorded and
 * it runs again on the next start.
