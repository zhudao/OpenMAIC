/**
 * MAIC Agent — agent runtime construction.
 *
 * Stands up a pi `Agent` with:
 * - injected StreamFn (-> OpenMAIC connector),
 * - request-scoped tools supplied by the route,
 * - a `beforeToolCall` allowlist gate (v0 capability restriction = tool allowlist,
 *   NOT a hardcoded workflow). Adding capability later = widening this set.
 * - a `afterToolCall` quota hook (v0 stub: unlimited).
