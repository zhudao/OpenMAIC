/**
 * The model settings of an earlier build that could not be moved to the
 * server (RFC #1701, tracked in #1725, P2).
 *
 * TEMPORARY, like the rest of this directory: see ./README.md.
 *
 * The version 5 settings migration drops the old settings once they are
 * staged, so whatever the import could not carry over would otherwise be
 * lost with its keys: a custom speech service, a key pair, a provider the
 * server refused (a custom endpoint for a media service, say). Those are kept
 * here, in this browser only, exactly as they were staged: Settings → Model
 * Services lists them once with the reason, so the user can set them up again,
 * and the user discards them. They are never sent anywhere: nothing reads this
 * key but the notice.
