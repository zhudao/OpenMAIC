/**
 * The importer's completion ledger: what has already moved to the server from
 * this browser.
 *
 * Once per browser, not once per owner, and the server decides whose: the
 * ledger holds a random browser id (128 bits), and the server binds that id
 * to the first owner that asks (`lib/persistence/legacy-import-bindings.ts`).
 * A claim carries the binding to the account. The ledger itself holds no
 * owner information at all.
 *
 * One key, `maic:legacy-import:v3`, in localStorage. The browser id also
 * derives fresh course ids (`ids.ts`). Clear Local Cache keeps the ledger
 * (and, until the import is complete, the pre-runtime quiz keys), so clearing the cache neither loses import
 * state nor brings back a course the user deleted after it was imported.
 *
 * Every step is recorded as soon as it lands, so a reload or crash mid-import
 * resumes at the first unfinished step. Writes merge with what is stored, so
 * two tabs running without Web Locks do not erase each other's progress. The
 * server is still the authority for what exists: a step whose ledger write was
 * lost is re-checked against it (see `course.ts`), never blindly repeated.
