/**
 * Refuse, as the server starts, a database this release must not run against.
 *
 * Every store is provisioned lazily -- the persistence provider on the first
 * request or background pass, the agent runtime's stores on first use -- and a
 * failure there is answered and retried. That is right for an unreachable
 * database, which may come up a moment later, but not for a refusal no retry
 * can change: a database that records a schema version newer than this
 * release knows (it was upgraded by a newer release), or, outside production,
 * an applied migration whose checksum changed. Such a server would stay up
 * answering every request that touches the store with a 500.
 *
 * So the start reads the recorded versions of every store this application
 * knows ({@link APP_SCHEMA_STORES}) -- read-only, creating nothing, so a store
 * of a disabled feature is checked without being provisioned -- and a refusal
 * exits the process like any other boot failure. Started without being
 * awaited: `register()` must not block on I/O.
