/**
 * Retired owner ids, and the identity lock that orders writes against their
 * retirement.
 *
 * A claim (`./owner-claims.ts`) moves an anonymous owner's work to an account
 * and records the move in `owner_merges`. From then on the anonymous id is
 * retired: core forwards it to the account for work that runs on behalf of an
 * owner after the request that named it (an agent run, a generation job), and
 * refuses writes a request makes under it.
 *
 * ## The identity lock
 *
 * Every write that creates or changes an owner's rows takes a per-owner
 * advisory lock as its transaction's first statement, in shared mode; a claim
 * takes the same lock in exclusive mode for both owners it joins, before it
 * touches a row. So a write either commits before the claim starts (and the
 * claim moves what it wrote) or runs after the claim committed (and sees the
 * id retired). Because it is the first lock on both sides, no write can hold a
 * row the claim needs while waiting for the claim: the lock-order deadlocks a
 * multi-table re-key would otherwise risk with document saves, asset
 * allocations and runtime writes cannot form.
 *
 * The retirement read is a separate statement after the lock: under READ
 * COMMITTED a statement's snapshot is taken when it starts, so a read in the
 * same statement as a lock wait could miss a claim that committed during the
 * wait.
