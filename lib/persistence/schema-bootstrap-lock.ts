 * Run a schema bootstrap with every other instance's bootstrap held off.
 *
 * `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` and
 * `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` are not atomic across sessions: two instances
 * starting together against the same database can both decide an object is
 * missing and one fails on the catalog's unique index (or with "tuple
 * concurrently updated"), which answers its first request with a 500. The
 * statements are idempotent one at a time, so running the bootstraps one
 * after another is all it takes.
 *
 * The lock is session-level and taken on one dedicated connection, which runs
 * every statement of `body` and is released in `finally`: the lock cannot be
 * held by a connection that went back to the pool, and a connection that dies
 * mid-bootstrap releases it with the session. Each store's versioned
 * migrations (`applySchemaMigrations` in `@openmaic/storage/pg-migrations`)
 * are serialized on their own as well; this lock, at the application's
 * bootstrap, serializes the whole sequence -- package tables and this
 * application's own (`stage_meta`, owner materials) alike, where one store's
 * migrations depend on another's tables -- and every caller that provisions
 * schema goes through this one helper.
 *
 * Session-level advisory locks need a direct or session-pooled connection; a
 * pooler in transaction mode (PgBouncer `pool_mode = transaction`) is not
 * supported.
