/**
 * Server-side resolution of a client-allocated asset id for extraction.
 *
 * Compatibility read fallback for callers that already hold an allocated
 * server asset id. New app flows do not allocate registry assets, but retained
 * documents and SDK clients may still name an existing entry.
 *
 * The resolution answers in five states so the route can map each to an honest
 * HTTP status: not configured (no `DATABASE_URL`), unauthenticated (owner
 * resolution refused the request), missing (no entry under
 * this id that this owner may read), too large (the recorded byte length
 * exceeds the caller-supplied cap, rejected before any bytes are read), or
 * resolved.
 *
 * "May read" is the persistence route's own rule (`./owner-assets.ts`): the
 * owner's own entries, legacy shared entries, and other owners' committed
 * entries that a live course references.
