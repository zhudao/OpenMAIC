/**
 * Claiming anonymous work on sign-in.
 *
 * A visitor who works anonymously and then signs in has two owners: the
 * anonymous one their courses, folders, materials, agent sessions, skills,
 * runtime records and media were written under, and the account. A claim
 * moves everything the anonymous owner holds to the account, in one
 * transaction, and records the move in `owner_merges` so the anonymous id is
 * retired from then on (see `./owner-merges.ts` for what retirement means to
 * later writes).
 *
 * ## Participants
 *
 * Each owner-keyed store re-keys its own rows through a participant. Core
 * registers the stores it ships; a host with tables of its own registers
 * participants for them from `instrumentation.ts` with
 * {@link registerClaimParticipant}, before the first claim (the registry is
 * sealed then, like the other host registries).
 *
 * Participants run in ascending `order` (ties by name) inside the claim's
 * transaction, after it holds both owners' identity locks exclusively:
 *
 * | order | participant       | rows                                                   |
 * |------:|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
 * |   100 | `document-folders`| `document_folders`, `document_stages.folder_id`        |
 * |   200 | `courses`         | `stage_meta` (and the retired `document_stages.owner_id`) |
 * |   300 | `owner-materials` | `owner_material`                                       |
 * |   400 | `agent-sessions`  | `agent_sessions`, the owner session-event projection   |
 * |   500 | `user-skills`     | `agent_user_skill`                                     |
 * |   600 | `runtime`         | `runtime_sessions` (records follow their session)      |
 * |   700 | `assets`          | `asset_entries.principal`                              |
 *
 * Why this order. Every core write path takes the identity lock first, so none
 * of them can be holding a row a claim wants while it waits for the claim: for
 * the rows those paths write, the identity lock is the guarantee, whatever the
 * order. The order is for lockers that do not take it (the offline asset
 * collector, host paths). For the tables a document write spans, the claim
 * locks rows in the order that write does: the `stage_meta` rows first (the
 * folders participant locks the source's before it re-files any
 * `document_stages` row), then document rows, then asset entries last, where
 * the collector and the document write lock them too. Folders run before
 * courses because they read ownership before it moves (a course's folder is
 * resolved against the owner that filed it). The package's session merge
 * locks sessions before the projection counters, as an event append does. A
 * host participant that locks core rows should take an order after the core
 * tables it reads; one that touches only its own tables can take any order
 * (1000 and up is left free for hosts). This is what the tests show: no
 * deadlock between a claim and the fenced writers, including a claim parked
 * mid-way; the collector is not fenced, and a pass racing a claim over the
 * same entries can still make PostgreSQL abort one side (answered as a
 * retryable `OWNER_BUSY`).
 *
 * ## Rules
 *
 * - `from` must be an owner the auth methods describe as anonymous
 *   (`principalFromStoredOwner`), and `to` must not be anonymous. A
 *   `pendingClaim` always names an anonymous cookie owner, which is.
 * - Idempotent: claiming a pair that is already merged succeeds and does
 *   nothing, so a retried request or a second tab is harmless.
 * - A `from` already claimed into a different account is refused: an anonymous
 *   identity's work belongs to the first account that claimed it.
 * - No chains. `to` must not itself be retired, and `from` must not have
 *   absorbed other owners. Since only anonymous owners are claimed and only
 *   non-anonymous owners claim, a merge is always one hop, and canonicalizing
 *   an id is one lookup.
 * - Waits are bounded: the identity locks for `OWNER_CLAIM_LOCK_WAIT_MS`
 *   (default 5 s; while a claim waits, PostgreSQL queues new writers of both
 *   owners behind it, so this wait is kept short), every later lock for 30 s.
 *   Losing a lock race is `OwnerClaimError('OWNER_BUSY')`, which changes
 *   nothing and may be retried as it is.
 * - Quotas are not enforced on the target: nothing is dropped, so an account
 *   can end up above its asset, material, skill or folder limit. It keeps
 *   everything and cannot add more until it is back under.
