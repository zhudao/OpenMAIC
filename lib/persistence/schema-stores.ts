/**
 * Every schema store this application provisions, in its bootstrap order: the
 * storage package's PostgreSQL backends and this application's own tables.
 *
 * Several are provisioned lazily, by the feature that uses them (the agent
 * runtime's sessions, session materials and user skills, generation runs), so no single
 * bootstrap call covers them all. This list is what the startup check verifies
 * against the database (./schema-boot-check.ts), and what the upgrade and
 * checksum tests enumerate; a new store belongs here.
