/**
 * Per-owner asset partitions over one server asset registry.
 *
 * Every allocation is stored under a principal derived from the request owner
 * ({@link assetPrincipalForOwner}), so quota is accounted per owner and the
 * store's own per-principal checks make replace and delete owner-only.
 *
 * Reads stay capability-by-id, because a course is readable by id and its
 * viewers must be able to load the media it names. The store itself only
 * answers a principal's own entries, so {@link createOwnerAssetStore} adds one
 * rule on top of it: an entry held by another owner is readable when it is
 * committed and a live (not tombstoned) course **of that same owner**
 * references it. A pending allocation stays private to its owner until one of
 * the owner's own document writes claims it: document writes reference and
 * commit only the writer's own entries and legacy ones
 * ({@link assetReferencePrincipalsForOwner}), so naming another owner's id in
 * a course records nothing. The owner check in the read rule is defense in
 * depth on top of that: a reference row that did not come from the entry's
 * owner (restored out of band, say) still exposes nothing.
 *
 * Entries written before per-owner partitions existed all live under the one
 * deployment-wide principal {@link LEGACY_SHARED_ASSET_PRINCIPAL}:
 *
 * - They stay readable by id to every owner, exactly as before.
 * - They can be replaced or deleted by an owner who owns every course that
 *   references them (at least one). Nobody else can prove a claim on them, so
 *   nobody else may mutate them. The check and the mutation run in one
 *   transaction holding the entry row lock, which a concurrent document write
 *   adding a reference must wait for, so a reference cannot slip in between.
 * - Everything else about them is the server lifecycle's: deleting or editing
 *   the referencing course withdraws its references and the collector
 *   reclaims the entry, as it always did.
 *
 * They are never re-keyed to an owner: quota for them stays with the legacy
 * partition, and no client-supplied identity is involved at any point.
