/**
 * The ledger of the one-time import of file-stored classrooms
 * (`lib/server/legacy-classroom-import.ts`).
 *
 * One row per legacy classroom id the import has an outcome for:
 *
 * - `imported`: written in the course's own create transaction, so the two
 *   cannot disagree. Final.
 * - `skipped`: the classroom cannot be imported as it stands (invalid, a
 *   reservation placeholder, its id taken, the create refused by the host, or
 *   it failed {@link MAX_IMPORT_ATTEMPTS} times). Final, with the reason.
 * - `failed`: an attempt failed; `attempts` counts them and `detail` holds the
 *   last error. Retried until it becomes one of the two above.
 *
 * A classroom the run never reached (the run stopped first) has no row.
 *
 * Temporary, like the importer: remove with it.
