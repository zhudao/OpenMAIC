/**
 * Which owner a browser's pre-server data belongs to, decided by the server.
 *
 * The one-way import of what earlier builds kept in a browser
 * (`lib/legacy-browser-import/`) runs once per browser: the browser keeps a
 * random id, and the first owner that binds it here holds it. The binding is
 * a row, inserted atomically, so two owners racing from two tabs cannot both
 * win; a claim re-keys it with everything else the claimed owner held (it is
 * a claim participant, `./owner-claims.ts`), so the account a visitor signs in
 * to simply owns it afterwards.
 *
 * Every request the importer sends carries its browser id in
 * `X-OpenMAIC-Legacy-Import`, and owner resolution refuses such a request
 * with `409 LEGACY_IMPORT_NOT_BOUND` unless the owner it resolves to holds the
 * binding (`lib/server/identity/with-owner.ts`). The importer can therefore
 * never write under an owner that does not hold the browser, whatever its
 * page believes the owner is.
 *
 * Temporary, like the importer: remove with it.
