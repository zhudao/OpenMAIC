/**
 * The course document a run produces, written through the owner-bound
 * document store of background work (a claim during the run moves the course
 * to the account, as it moves every other course).
 *
 * The document is created when the first scene is ready, at the moment the
 * browser navigates to the classroom, and marked as produced by a server job
 * so no browser generates into it; every later scene is appended as it
 * completes, and `generationComplete` is set at the end. Every write is fenced
 * by the run's lease and commits with the run's checkpoint, so a worker whose
 * run was taken over cannot write, and a write and its checkpoint never part.
