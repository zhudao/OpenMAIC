/**
 * The shared shape of the course generation steps (RFC #1754 §E).
 *
 * Each step is the classic step logic the generation API routes used to hold,
 * as a plain `(input, ctx) => output` function: the server-side runs, the
 * remaining routes (images, video, narration) and the Pro agent's tools call
 * the same code, and only who orchestrates the steps differs. A step knows nothing about HTTP. Request parsing, owner
 * resolution, access gates, status codes and response shapes stay with the
 * caller, which also resolves what a request names (the model, the
 * connection of a media slot, the web-search configuration) and hands the
 * result in, so the deprecated request fields never reach a step.
