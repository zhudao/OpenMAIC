/**
 * Slot resolution at request time (RFC #1701, tracked in #1725).
 *
 * The configured answer comes from the deployment layer (openmaic.yml, loaded
 * once per process) and the workspace layer (the request owner's web
 * settings), walked together over the whole slot tree: a workspace model on
 * `llm` covers every chat slot below it. Only when that leaves a slot
 * unassigned does a caller look further, first at what a request still names
 * the old way (model and key headers, deprecated) and then at the defaults an
 * older deployment set through DEFAULT_MODEL and friends. The defaults are a
 * second walk rather than a third layer in the first one, so that a default
 * never outranks a workspace choice made higher up the tree.
