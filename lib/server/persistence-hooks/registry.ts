/**
 * The process-wide host extension hooks, registered the way the owner
 * auth methods are (`lib/server/identity/registry.ts`): once, from
 * `instrumentation.ts` `register()`, before the server serves a request.
 *
 * Two entry points, because they are consumed by different layers and sealed
 * at different moments: {@link configurePersistenceHooks} (course creation,
 * the library listing, upload admission) is sealed by the first request that
 * reads the hooks, and {@link configureAssetByteStore} by the first byte store
 * built -- the persistence provider's, or the collector's. Configuring either
 * after its first use throws: a process must not serve some requests with a
 * hook and others without.
 *
 * The state lives on `globalThis` because Next can evaluate this module more
 * than once in one process (the instrumentation hook and route bundles), and
 * all of them must see the one registration.
