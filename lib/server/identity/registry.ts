 * Core asks the methods in order for every request (`./resolve.ts`), and when
 * none applies falls back to the built-in anonymous cookie
 * (`./anonymous-cookie.ts`) unless the registration turned that off.
 *
 * Unregistered — the default — the list comes from the environment on every
 * request: `PERSISTENCE_SHARED_OWNER_ID` (validated, and requiring
 * `ACCESS_CODE`) makes it `[sharedTeam]`, `OWNER_SINGLE_USER=true`
 * (validated) makes it `[singleUser]`, setting both is refused, and otherwise it is empty and every
 * request is an anonymous owner. Reading the environment per call keeps a
 * value changed for a test observable without a module reload.
 *
 * The state lives on `globalThis` because Next can evaluate this module more
 * than once in one process (the instrumentation hook and route bundles), and
 * all of them must see the one registration.
