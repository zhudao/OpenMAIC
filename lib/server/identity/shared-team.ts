/**
 * The `sharedTeam` built-in: one deployment-wide owner, for single-tenant
 * installations.
 *
 * Course documents, folders, materials and agent sessions are partitioned by an
 * owner id. Without a host auth layer that id comes from a 30-day anonymous
 * cookie (`./anonymous-cookie.ts`), which means one physical browser is one learner: a
 * second browser sees an empty course list, a cleared cookie looks like a new
 * installation, and `POST /api/stages/[id]/publish` refuses every owner because
 * an anonymous principal does not hold the `course:publish` role.
 *
 * For one team behind one `ACCESS_CODE` that partitioning buys nothing — those
 * visitors already share the site password and can read each other's courses by
 * id (`SECURITY.md` says as much about `ACCESS_CODE`). `PERSISTENCE_SHARED_OWNER_ID`
 * replaces the cookie-derived id with that fixed value, so the deployment has
 * one course library, and publishing works: the shared principal holds
 * `course:publish`.
 *
 * It **requires** `ACCESS_CODE`, and refuses to run without one: see the note
 * in {@link resolveSharedOwnerId}. It is also not a substitute for server
 * persistence — Postgres answers where courses live, this answers who owns
 * them, and a multi-user or multi-instance deployment still wants the former.
 *
 * Unset — the default — changes nothing: every request keeps resolving to its
 * cookie partition.
 *
 * It is a method like any other (`./registry.ts`): with no host registration,
 * setting the variable makes it the only method; a host that registers its
 * own methods and wants the team owner too includes {@link sharedTeamAuthMethod}
 * last in its list. It has no credential, so it always authenticates: nothing
 * after it is ever asked, including the anonymous fallback.
