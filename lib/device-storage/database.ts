/**
 * Device-local IndexedDB storage.
 *
 * Durable user data -- courses, chat history, learner progress and the bytes
 * of generated media -- lives on the server, behind the HTTP persistence
 * seams. What stays in this browser is what belongs to this device and may be
 * lost without losing anything the server does not also hold:
 *
 * - `audioFiles` / `mediaFiles`: a local copy of narration and generated media
 *   the pool already stores (it saves a re-download), plus bytes a full store
 *   refused, kept so a Retry re-attempts the upload instead of paying a
 *   provider again, and per-element failure records so a refused or failed
 *   generation is not retried on every reload;
 * - `snapshots`: the editor's undo/redo history;
 * - `voiceProfiles`: TTS voice profiles registered from this browser (a
 *   provider setting, like the rest of the settings kept in localStorage);
 * - `autoVoiceCache`: reference clips for re-registering auto voices;
 * - `courseThumbnails`: the home library's derived course thumbnails (a
 *   course's first slide and its media bytes), so a reload shows them without
 *   reading the course again (see `lib/utils/course-thumbnail-cache.ts`).
 *
 * This is a database of its own (`maic-device-cache`), separate from the
 * pre-server browser database (`MAIC-Database`), which is read-only and kept
 * only for the one-way importer (see `lib/legacy-browser-storage`). Clearing
 * the local cache deletes this database and nothing else.
