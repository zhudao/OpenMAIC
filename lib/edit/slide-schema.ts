/**
 * SlideContent schema versioning. Slide-surface PRs will iterate the
 * on-disk shape; this module is the single chokepoint for normalizing
 * any incoming SlideContent (API response, snapshot restore, future
 * localStorage restore, PPTX reimport) to the current version.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *   - `migrateSlideContent` is pure (returns a new reference only when
 *     it has to change something) and idempotent (running it twice is
 *     identical to running it once).
 *   - Each schema bump appends a step keyed by the previous version's
 *     number. v1 (current) needs no per-step migration body — just the
 *     guarantee that the field is present.
