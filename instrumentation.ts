 * That makes it the only place in this app where a background schedule can
 * live: a route module has no such guarantee — it can be instantiated more than
 * once and gets no shutdown hook — so anything periodic started from one is
 * really started per instantiation.
 *
 * `register` must return before the server is ready, so nothing here may block
 * on I/O. Starting a timer does not.
