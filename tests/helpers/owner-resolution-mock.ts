/**
 * Route tests stub owner resolution with a plain function of the request that
 * returns an owner id and may append `Set-Cookie` values to the headers it is
 * given, exactly like a minting auth method would. This adapts such a stub to
 * the `@/lib/server/identity/resolve` module, so a test can write
 *
 *   vi.mock('@/lib/server/identity/resolve', async () =>
 *     (await import('../helpers/owner-resolution-mock')).ownerResolveModule(mocks.resolveOwnerId),
 *   );
 *
 * and keep asserting on route behavior. A plain `anon:` id becomes an
 * anonymous principal without roles; any other plain id a signed-in principal
 * holding `course:publish` — the test-side stand-in for "not anonymous". A stub
 * that needs something else returns an owner object instead, whose `kind`,
 * `roles` and `assurance` override those defaults.
